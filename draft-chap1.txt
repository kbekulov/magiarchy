Elegant facades adorned with intricate carvings, worn cobblestone streets, and ornate fountains coexisted with occasional glass-and-steel office skyscrapers that seemed to intrude upon the scene, like unwelcome guests at a sophisticated soiree.
The sunlight danced on the river's surface, causing the water to shimmer and sparkle like a thousand tiny diamonds.

The beauty of these late summer weeks was ephemeral, however, as autumn was eager to step early into the scene, heralding the arrival of rains and melancholic landscapes.
Lynleit sat in the riverside cafe, sipping her iced coffee and listening to the sounds of the city. She watched as people passed by, their faces tired and drawn from work and the suffocating heat. The sky was clear but a dark blanket of rainclouds was slowly approaching in the distance. A storm loomed on the horizon, casting an eerie pallor over the city, and she could feel the weight of the impending rain pressing down on her. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and the faint odour of cigarette smoke wafting in from a nearby table. As she gazed out at the river, she couldn't help but feel a sense of dread about the future. She knew that a rain was coming, and with it, the unsettling unknown.

She reached up to adjust a tiny device in her ear, listening intently, with her eyes lost in the distance. Occasionally, she hummed in response to the person on the other end of the call.
Meanwhile, Felix strode into the bustling café, inhaling deeply and savouring the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee beans. He took his time scanning the busy establishment, looking for any signs of suspicious activity. His excessive caution was not instinctive, but merely a formality imposed on him by his work. In the corner of his eye, he noticed a young female barista working behind the counter. He proceeded to sauntered up to the counter. With a playful smile on his face he ordered his coffee. Awaiting his spicy iced latte, he stole glances at his phone, keeping an eye on the screen. His attention was soon diverted, however, as the female barista smiled at him and asked if there was anything else she could get for him.

"Oh, just your number," Felix quipped, flashing his most charming smile.
The barista chuckled, but shook her head. "Sorry, I'm taken."

Lynleit curiously observed Felix from a distance, as he was making a fool of himself at the counter. She couldn't believe how little regard he had for the seriousness of his job.

Felix felt a buzz in his hand, and quickly checked his phone. The feed from his drone was finally up and running, and he could see a young man in a brown leather jacket making his way through the city park. Felix muttered a quick “Lucky bastard!” to the barista, and turned his way in Lynleit's direction. With his coffee and phone in hands, he approached the table by the river, a sheepish look on his face. "I struck out with Maria," he said, shrugging his shoulders.

Lynleit rolled her eyes. "I wish you’d have just as much passion for your work as you have for chasing skirts," she complained. Felix grinned, knowing that Lyn was only half-serious. "I'm sorry, boss.” he said, only to receive a stern look in response. Feeling slightly ashamed, he added "Lyn, come on. I know. But I can't help it. The girl’s really cute," while glancing back at the barista. Lynleit seemed slightly annoyed, but couldn't help smiling a little. "Just keep your eyes on the mission. We don't want to lose track of the target,” she said, turning her attention to the phone in Felix’s hand.

“Right, about that. The drone's feed is up and running. Kyrien's on the move," he said, offering his phone to Lyn. She nodded, watching the drone's footage intently.
"Good to know. But focus on the mission, will you?”

Kyrien walked alone in the large abandoned park, surrounded by the eerie silence of the rustling leaves and creaking branches. The sky above was dim and grey, with a thick blanket of clouds obscuring the sun. He felt a cool breeze on his face, carrying with it a faint scent of rain. He tightened the straps of his backpack, and his fingers fidgeted nervously with the open laptop in his hands. As he walked, he constantly scanned his surroundings, wary of any signs of people.
The rustling of leaves in the wind was accompanied by a faint hum of city traffic in the distance.

Reiner's footsteps were soft and barely audible. He had been tailing Kyrien for close to an hour. Keeping a safe distance was possible but complicated, as the thickness of the forest made it hard to maintain visual contact. Kyrien advanced hastily through the park's maze of paths, although occasionally it seemed that he could have been wandering aimlessly. He glanced up at the clouds at regular intervals, as though on the lookout for something, or someone, in particular.
"Did you manage to confirm the contents of the backpack?" Lyn’s voice crackled through Reiner’s earpiece. Reiner hesitated for a moment before responding. "Negative."

"It's probably explosives or some other shit, like handmade firearms," Felix interjected with an air of superiority in his tone.

Lyn chose to ignore his comment and awaited patiently for Reiner's report.

Unsatisfied with her silence, Felix added, "Frankly speaking, I have no idea why you even care. Why would he require the personal attention of a top officer? Sounds to me like a wannabe terrorist with an overblown sense of self-righteousness."

Lyn glanced at Felix, unamused.

“And there we go - she again smiled at me menacingly.” Felix joked, as kicked back on his seat and turned his attention back to his coffee.

Lyn flinched as a sudden burst of static pierced her ear. Her hand shot to the earpiece, yanking it out with violent urgency.

“What the hell?!” she cried out, trying to fight back the sharp pain in her head.

Carefully inspecting the earpiece, she hesitated before putting it back in her ear. "Reiner, can you hear me?" She managed to maintain an even tone, though her concern was palpable. To answer her, there was nothing but static noise coming from the other end. Her gaze quickly fell on Felix, who seemed to be wrestling with his phone.

"What's wrong?" she inquired, having noticed his unease. Felix's hands quivered as he swiped at the unresponsive screen in frustration. "The feed's gone black."

Lyn's fist tightened, its knuckles whitening. She glanced around, her eyes darting between Felix and her surroundings, struggling to make sense of the situation. The previously suffocating heat started to dissipate, replaced by an unexpected chill carried by the strengthening wind.

"Reiner, please respond," she pleaded, her voice determined yet strained. The static persisted, the chilling noise seeped into her bones igniting an unsettling sense of silent panic.

The atmosphere around them began to shift as the wind picked up, causing the leaves on the trees to rustle and dance in the gusts. The once calm riverside cafe was now being overtaken by an uneasy tension as the impending storm loomed closer.

Lyn could feel the change in the air, the pressure building as the storm approached, mimicking the tension and anxiety that had taken root in her chest. Her dark hair whipped around her face, the sudden chill causing goosebumps to rise on her skin.

“I feel sick.” she muttered, her body shivered. Felix didn’t respond, but the look in his eyes conveyed he had, similarly, felt the sudden onset of inexplicable nausea.

Kyrien's encounter
Hovering eight to ten meters above the river, there was a man. His figure seemed to defy gravity, suspended in mid-air. The man was clad in a long, ashen grey coat, and a hat concealed his features, casting a shadow across his face. Kyrien blinked rapidly, convinced that his vision had somehow betrayed him, conjuring a grotesque illusion. Yet, the image persisted, hauntingly defying logic as the man remained suspended, tethered to nothing but the air itself.

The man's posture was unnervingly unnatural. His body slumped forward, an eerie marionette devoid of a puppeteer's guiding strings. His feet dangled limply, swaying with a sinister lethargy, as if anchored to some unseen force. An icy dread slithered down Kyrien's spine, the sensation akin to a cold whisper caressing his skin. His heart raced, pounding against his ribcage in a primal rhythm. He strained to glimpse the man's face, but it remained concealed beneath the brim of his hat. The angle of the man's head was disquietingly off-kilter, as though his neck had been twisted into an impossible contortion.

The levitating man was a haunting, enigmatic figure, one that defied all logic and rational thought. The sheer impossibility of the scene was both mesmerising and horrifying, a cruel paradox that began to question Kyrien's grip on reality.
Reiner's encounter
Without warning, a rustling in the trees above caught Reiner's attention. As he looked up, his blood froze in his veins. A humanoid creature, unnervingly agile and silent, crept and leaped among the branches. Its limbs appeared too long and too thin, defying the natural proportions of a human. The creature's eyes were black and gleaming, seemingly locked onto Reiner with a predatory intent.

Despite his stoic, cold-minded demeanour and athletic body, Reiner found himself grappling with a terror that threatened to overtake him like no other before. The creature's inhuman agility and its near-invisibility to all but the keenest observer amplified his dread, the chilling sight of it burrowing deep into his psyche.

In a moment of panic, Reiner drew his handgun and held it at the ready. The creature darted from tree to tree with unnatural speed, its movements jerky and unsettling. With each leap, it seemed to defy the laws of physics, further cementing its status as a terrifying enigma. Reiner tracked its every move with the barrel of his gun, a growing sense of fear and confusion gripped his mind.

Reiner's entire world was consumed by the need to destroy the terrifying being that had invaded his reality.
