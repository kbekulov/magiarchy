> The story world combines multiple genres and styles into a single unique blend, expressing them individually through its characters and character groups.Each character follows a unique subplot, colliding with the subplots of others. This transforms the story into an 'epic' with an expansive world and a sandbox of unlimited potential to produce new characters and subplots for past, current, and future timelines.
