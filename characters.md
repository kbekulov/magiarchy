### MSF
- **Lynleit** is a 27-year-old woman of mixed Asian-European heritage, standing 170 cm tall with a slim and feminine build. She has striking blue eyes and long black wavy hair, often styled elegantly. Her typical attire includes a blue trench coat, white blouse with a black ribbon, black shorts, black opaque tights, and leather over-knee boots. Known for her warm, empathetic nature, Lynleit is deeply duty-driven, striving to balance her natural kindness with the calculated leadership required to uphold her father's legacy at MSF. Despite struggling to balance her natural personality with her professional persona, she's seen as a guiding light, affectionately nicknamed by her colleagues as the "Housecat of MSF" for her elegant yet protective demeanour.
- **Witch Lynleit** is a composed and enigmatic woman. Her striking blue eyes hold a quiet intensity, sharp and observant, reflecting experience beyond what her younger counterpart can comprehend. Her long black hair is styled into a high, twisted bun, secured with dark ribbons that extend and flutter behind her, adding an air of movement and presence. A few sharp, deliberate strands frame her face, giving her an assertive yet controlled look.
Her attire is practical yet refined, favoring dark, fitted clothing suited for both movement and presence. She wears a black cloak fastened at the waist by a deep blue sash intertwined with a black leather belt. Beneath, she opts for sleek, form-fitting black attire, including leather-trimmed pants and high lace-up boots, blending function with a quiet sense of authority..
Unlike the duty-driven Lynleit of the illusionary world, Witch Lyn carries a certainty that comes with understanding the reality her younger self has yet to grasp. Her magic is far stronger, and whenever she appears, blue glowing spider-lilies sprout at random, serving as an unmistakable sign of her presence. Though she remains a mystery, her arrival signals an undeniable truth—she is not just a shadow of what could be, but the true reality bleeding into the dream.

- **Reiner** is a 35 years old man, standing tall at 188 cm with a well-built, athletic physique. His clean-shaven head and facial stubble complement his silent, introverted nature. Known for his machine-like precision and unwavering focus, Reiner approaches every task with cold, logical reasoning, showing little emotion and focusing intensely on tasks.

Well-groomed with a short beard and goatee, he often wears a few rings, adding to his refined appearance. Fionn’s leadership style is understated yet purposeful, reflecting his eloquence and strategic mind. His relationship with Lynleit is warm yet marked by a subtle distance, stemming from unspoken gaps in their communication.

Helena typically wears red clothing paired with black, often favouring a red turtleneck and black pants or tights with heeled boots. She is both seductive and persuasive, yet her cold, profit-driven nature often surfaces, especially when pursuing her goals. This creates a strained relationship with Lynleit, highlighting their contrasting approaches and values.
- **Tien** is Helena's secretive bodyguard and assassin, often working behind the scenes. He mirrors Kyrien's talents but operates on a more professional level, motivated by personal grievances and financial incentives. As Kyrien's psychological shadow archetype, Tien represents what Kyrien could have become without Lynleit's influence. Elusive and rarely seen overtly, Tien's presence in the story highlights the path of darkness that contrasts with Kyrien's journey towards light. His encounters with Kyrien often end in a draw, underscoring their complex relationship and the thematic contrast between them.
